### Quickbooks Credentials Refresher
Quickbooks authentication makes it difficult to keep credentials up to date...

They will expire after 1 hour if you don't refresh them, and then you must manually open
a browser and get new credentials. Quickbooks has a site called the 
[OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/playground) which is useful for this. A prior version of the connector 
had a function for this but its honestly easier to just use the Quickbooks 
provided site than running a script.
